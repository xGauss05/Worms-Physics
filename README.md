# Clowns Physics (Worms Theory project)

- [Repository LINK](https://github.com/xGauss05/Worms-Physics)

## Description
A worms-like game, but instead of worms, we use clowns.

## Key Features
Physics engine done from scratch. All of the work is done by us. Use the plane to have a drag force while on the air.
Clowns can jump infinitely. Why? Because they are clowns. 
The main objective is to pop all balloons using your own projectiles. You lose if you fall off the scene.
